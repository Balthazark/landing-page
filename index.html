        <h2 class="about-me">About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently a third year student at Chalmers University of Technology where I study software enginering. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of school and my courses, I like to be an active member of the student union and engage in creating and supporting the great campus life here on Chalmers. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Right now, I am very intrested in learning more about web development. Therefore I have began learning html, css and javascript outside of 
           school. The different areas and topics I want to learn mroe about ranges from databases, the backend and its existing frameworks, to the frontend mainly focusing on React.
